# shakespeare-sonnet-generator

This repo contains code for randomly generating sonnets from Shakespeare's sonnets. It works by retrieving all Shakespeare sonnets (source: https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/download/) and extracting the rhyming lines from the sonnets (knowing the form is ABABCDCDEFEFGG). Then, the code randomly chooses 7 rhyming couplets and arranges them into a new sonnet.
